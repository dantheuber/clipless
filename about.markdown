## About Clipless

Clipless is a powerful and intelligent clipboard manager built with modern technologies including Electron, React, and TypeScript. Designed specifically for professionals who work with data across multiple systems, Clipless transforms the simple act of copying and pasting into a sophisticated workflow tool.

### 🎯 Our Mission

To eliminate the friction between data and productivity. Whether you're a call center agent juggling customer information across multiple systems, a data entry professional working with standardized formats, or a developer managing code snippets, Clipless streamlines your workflow.

### 🏗️ Built With Modern Technology

- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop application framework
- **React** - Modern user interface components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development for reliability
- **OS-Native Security** - Platform-specific encryption for data protection

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

Your data security is our priority:

- **Local Storage Only** - All clipboard data stays on your device
- **OS-Native Encryption** - Uses Windows DPAPI, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service
- **No Cloud Sync** - Your sensitive data never leaves your machine
- **Open Source** - Full transparency with publicly available code
