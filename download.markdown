## üõ°Ô∏è Installation Security Notice

**Important:** You may see security warnings during installation because Clipless is not signed with a commercial code signing certificate.

### What You Might See

#### Windows
- "Windows protected your PC" SmartScreen warning
- "Unknown publisher" notifications
- Antivirus software alerts

#### macOS
- "Cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
- Gatekeeper security warnings
- "Malicious software" notifications

#### Linux
- "Untrusted application" warnings
- Security policy restrictions
- Permission requirements

### Why This Happens

Code signing certificates cost several hundred dollars annually. As an open-source project, we don't currently have a commercial certificate. The security warnings are purely administrative - **the application itself is completely safe**.

### This is Safe to Override

‚úÖ **Clipless is built from open source code** - You can verify the source on GitHub  
‚úÖ **No malicious code** - Full transparency with public repository  
‚úÖ **Community verified** - Used by developers and professionals worldwide  
‚úÖ **Regular security updates** - Maintained with modern security practices
